# ReflexGame
Game created to be used as practice for code testing.

The game consists of random circles apearing on a random position on the screen, which the player must click as fast as possible.
As time passes, the size of the circles increases and the points gained decrease, so the highest score will be achieved when
the player manages to click the fastest on each appearing circle.
